This project focuses on creating an interactive 3D scene. We created a panorama, a flower garden with randomized variability, a pile of rocks topped with a hive, and an animated, controllable (with keys) bee that interacts with pollen and the hive. The scene also contains realistic grass animated with shaders to simulate wind effects. To understand the project better, there is an MP4 video included in the zip file. This project was implemented with JavaScript and CGF. (Look at project folder)
